# syntactic-parsing-app
###About of the project
This application uses the natural language toolkit to analyse a given language sample in the aim to help assess speech and language of those with delayed or disordered language skills. This is to be used by Speech and Language Therapist's or researchers of speech, language, linguistics, or human communication.

Please run the python programme, enter the input mode, then enter some language input and the programme will complete a full syntactic parsing.

Please note speech input mode will be a future feature of this programme but currenly speech to text conversion is not supported.
